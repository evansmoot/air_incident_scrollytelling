				<div class='title'>Deadliest Plane Crash in US History</div>
					On May 25, 1979, American Airlines Flight 191 was taking off from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois
					from a runway when it crashed into the ground. All 258 passengers and 13 crew on board were killed. It is known 
					as the deadliest aircraft incident in the United States.

				<div class='title'>Bar chart of the amount of Injury Severity of the elements in the first array. (firstArray in main.js)</div>
					There were a fair amount of fatal incidents in 1995-1996.

				<div class='title'>Bar chart of the amount of Injury Severity of elements in the last array. (tenthArray in main.js)</div>
					There are less fatal incidents in recent years.

				<div class='title'>Bar chart of the amount of aircraft incidents by broad phase of flight.</div>
					There are the most aircraft incidents in landing than approach or takeoff.

				<div class='title'>Planes crash in the United States... a lot</div>
				Of the nine countries with the most amount of crashes, the United States has over 900 more crashes than the country with the second most (the United Kingdom).

			<section class='step'>
				<div class='title'>Visual Meteorological Conditions are more dangerous than Instrumental Meteorological Conditions</div>
				Surprisingly, far more air accidents occur when pilots fly in VMC weather conditions (conditions that don't require them to use their instruments to fly).
			</section>
			<section class='step'>
				<div class='title'>Of the current major airlines in the US, Delta has seen the most crashes.</div>
					An airline's amount of crashes tend to correlate with the amount of years they've been active, except for United which was founded the same year as American (1926) and only one year after Delta.

				<div class='title'>Planes made by Boeing tend to crash the most</div>
					Boeing planes have crashed a total of 1,207 times, 900 times more than the next highest maker, McDonnell Douglas.
