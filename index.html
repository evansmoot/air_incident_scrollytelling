					This is a scrolling data story about aircraft incidents in the world. Scroll to start viewing the story.

				<div class='title'>One of the Deadliest Plane Crashes in the Entire World</div>
					On May 25, 1979, American Airlines Flight 191 was taking off from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois
					from a runway when it crashed into the ground. All 258 passengers and 13 crew on board were killed. It is known 
					as the deadliest aircraft incident in the United States.
			</section>
			<section class='step'>
				<div class='title'>Comparison between 1995 and 2015 aircraft incidents with minor, substantial, or complete damage</div>
					In 2015, there were more crashes with minor damage compared with 1995 but fewer crashes with substantial or complete damage.
			</section>
			<section class='step'>
				<div class='title'>During what parts of the flight are there the highest or lowest amount of crashes?</div>
					Surprisingly, the most aircraft incidents happened during taxi. The amount of aircraft incidents during takeoff comes as a close second. There are the fewest amount of aircraft incidents during maneuvering.
			</section>
			<section class='step'>
				<div class='title'>Planes crashes in the United States... a lot</div>
				Of the nine countries with the most amount of crashes, the United States has over 900 more crashes than the country with the second most (the United Kingdom).
			</section>
			<section class='step'>
				<div class='title'>Visual Meteorological Conditions are more dangerous than Instrumental Meteorological Conditions</div>
				Surprisingly, far more air accidents occur when pilots fly in VMC weather conditions (conditions that don't require them to use their instruments to fly).
			</section>
			<section class='step'>
				<div class='title'>Of the current major airlines in the US, Delta has seen the most crashes.</div>
					An airline's amount of crashes tend to correlate with the amount of years they've been active, except for United which was founded the same year as American (1926) and only one year after Delta.
			</section>
			<section class='step'>
				<div class='title'>Planes made by Boeing tend to crash the most</div>
					Boeing planes have crashed a total of 1,207 times, 900 times more than the next highest maker, McDonnell Douglas.
